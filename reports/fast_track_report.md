# 24-Hour Electricity Demand Forecasting - Fast-Track Assessment
## Bareilly Electricity Demand Forecast

### Problem Statement
This project addresses the challenge of forecasting electricity demand for Bareilly using a 7-day history window.

### Data Preparation
- **Data Source**: Smart-meter dataset from Kaggle containing 3-minute readings
- **Aggregation**: 3-minute data resampled to hourly by summing (kWh per hour)
- **Gap Handling**: Conservative forward-fill imputation for small gaps
- **Outlier Treatment**: 99th percentile capping with audit trail

### Methods
**Baseline Model**: Seasonal naive using same hour from previous day
**ML Model**: Ridge regression with features: hour-of-day, day-of-week, lags, rolling mean, temperature

### Results
**Model Performance Metrics:**
- Baseline MAE: 91.67 kWh
- ML Model MAE: 38.65 kWh
- Baseline WAPE: 9.80%
- ML Model WAPE: 4.04%

### Key Takeaways
1. **Model Performance**: The ML model shows improvement over the seasonal naive baseline
2. **Feature Importance**: Time-based features and lag features provide the strongest predictive power
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Simple residual-based scaling provides reasonable confidence intervals
